Detector,Mean Keypoint,Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shi-Tomasi,1342.3,Well placed very tiny circles around the edges of the car,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Harris,173.7,"Using parameters defined during instruction, very few key points but are mostly placed well around the intended edges of the vehicle",,,,,,,,,,,,,
FAST,1787.4,Smallest Circle size but places a decent amount of keypoints on other cars (this might be more a box sizing problem as they are placed well on the other cars),,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brisk,2706.555556,"Huge Circles on the peak corners,on average larger. Highest count of key points by far",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Orb,500,"Maxed number of keypoints at 500 with the incredibly large circles near the top of the vehicle, played around with different caps and anything higher than default was too chaotic",,,,,,,,,,,,,
AKAZE,1343,Medium to small size but struggles around the sloped top of the car,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SIFT,1386.1,Quite small circles but not accurately placed on car for a a decent amount around the sloped top of the car,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"From the results of my MP8 and MP9, it seems that the most ideal combinations in terms of total number of keypoints given is 1) FAST detector / BRIEF descriptor, 2) FAST detector / ORB decsriptor, 3) FAST detector / FREAK descriptor. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
